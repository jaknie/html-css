        <h2>THE BAND</h2>
        
        <p>The first name of a band was <b>"Fear of Flying".</b> 
        It had three members: Harry McVeigh (lead vocals, guitar), Jack Lawrence-Brown (drums) and Charles Cave, guitarist, described the band as a "weekend project". Band first played together in a school show at North Ealing Primary School.
        </p>
        
        <p>They disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating:
        "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... <strong>White Lies is alive!"</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>They introduced a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. The band said they chose the name because "white lies are quite dark...that's how we see ourselves" and that white lies "protect the upsetting truths" of the band's lyrics.
        </p>
        
        <p>On 10 March 2008, White Lies were announced as one of four bands taking part in the first ever NME New Noise Tour (now the NME Radar Tour). The tour visited eleven cities in the UK throughout May 2008. The band were first featured in the magazine in the issue dated 22 March 2008, appearing in the "Everyone's Talking About..." section of their Radar article. Live Editor Hamish MacBain described tracks "Death" and "XX" (later titled "Unfinished Business") - the only two songs available on the band's MySpace - as "...not to afraid of a little sincerity, not afraid of a little scale". The band released their debut single one month later, a 7-inch vinyl of "Unfinished Business" on 28 April 2008. The limited pressing was released by Chess Club Records, an independent record label co-founded by drummer Jack Brown. To mark the release, the band supported dEUS in London's Scala on 16 April 2008, as well as a performance at the 2008 Camden Crawl.
        </p>
        
        <p>They made their television debut on Later... with Jools Holland on 30 May 2008, playing "Unfinished Business" and "Death". This marked their final public performance prior to recording their debut album, scheduling sessions in ICP Studios in Belgium and Kore Studios in West London. The album was provisionally titled <b>To Lose My Life or Lose My Love</b>, with a scheduled release date was set for January 2009. The title came from a line in the album's title track, "To Lose My Life". </p>

            <div><h2>Big TV (2013)</h2></div>
            <p>Big TV was released on 12 August 2013 by Fiction Records in the UK and Europe, and on 20 August 2013 in the US (Harvest Records) and Canada (Universal Music Canada).
            The album was produced by Ed Buller at ICP Studios in Brussels, Belgium. 
            On 18 August 2013, the album debuted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.
            In an interview with NME in January 2013, bassist Charles Cave said that the album was the band's most melodic record, but continued the definitive White Lies sound. The album follows a story of a couple who leave a provincial area for a big city and, according to Cave, the idea of equality in a relationship is a recurring theme.
            Big TV was the first White Lies album to feature 12 rather than 10 tracks, two of which ("Space I" and "Space II") are instrumental interludes.
